## boredom

## General informations
This project is an activity generator for bored people. It uses a free API (no Cors error), and you can adjust the number of participants and your prefered activity type. I didn't use three parameters : accessibility, price and key. 
I use React but not the components syntaxe, so I should've used vanilla JavaScript. My next projects'll use more of React possibilities that's for sure. 

## Technology

React vers 18.2.0
